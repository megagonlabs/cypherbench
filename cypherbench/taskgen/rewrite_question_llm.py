REWRITE_PROMPT = """Rewrite the given template-generated question in a text-to-Cypher translation task to make it sound more natural:
- Ensure the rewritten question remains semantically equivalent to the original question and the provided Cypher query. Do not remove or add any constraints.
  - Pay attention to the direction of the relation pattern (indicated by `->` or `<-`) in the Cypher query.
    For example, `(n:Character)-[r0:hasFather]->(m0:Character)` indicates m0 is the father of n,
    while `(n:Character)<-[r0:hasFather]-(m0:Character)` matches n as the father of m0.
  - Pay attention to the direction of relation in the template-generated question.
    For example `List the names of Character that "Rhaenys Targaryen" hasFather"` means "Rhaenys Targaryen" connects 
    to the Character via relation `hasFather`, thus the questions is asking for the father of Rhaenys Targaryen.
    While `List the names of Character that hasFather "Rhaenys Targaryen"` selects the Character that has Rhaenys Targaryen as father.
- Ensure the rewritten question is grammatically correct and sounds natural.
- The brackets in the question are parsing hints for the question structure to ensure it is unambiguous. Do not include them in the rewritten question.
- For relation types (e.g. hasCastMember), rewrite them to natural language and diversify the expressions. Feel free to change from passive to active voice or vice versa.
  - e.g. A hasCastMember B -> B is cast in A, B stars in A, A features B, etc.
- For entity types (e.g. Person, FlightAccident) and properties (e.g. watershed_area_km2) rewrite them to natural language and diversify the expressions.
  - e.g. Person -> individual; human; passenger; etc. 
  - e.g. TaxonRank -> taxonomic rank; etc.
  - e.g. FlightAccident -> aviation accident; plane crash; etc.
  - e.g. watershed_area_km2 -> size of the watershed in square kilometers; area covered by the watershed in kmÂ²; etc.
- For multi-hop patterns, you can simplify it if the same meaning is preserved.
  - e.g. "teams that belong to a division that belongs to Western Conference" -> "teams in the Western Conference"
  - e.g. "the father of the mother of the person" -> "the person's maternal grandfather"
  - e.g. "the children of the father of the person" -> "the person's paternal siblings"
- For quoted names and string values, remove the quotes but ensure the same text is preserved.
- For numerical values and dates, diversify the expressions, but ensure the same value is preserved.
  - e.g. 1990-07-04 -> July 4th, 1990; 4 July 1990; 07/04/1990 (US format); 4th of July, 1990; etc.
  - e.g. 2000 -> two thousand; 2000; 2,000; 2k; etc.
- For operators (e.g. >, >=, IN, NOT IN, etc.), rewrite them to natural language and diversify the expressions but ensure the meaning is preserved.
  - e.g. NOT 'France' IN n.country_of_citizenship -> "is not a citizen of France"
- For "ascending" and "descending", rewrite them to natural language and diversify the expressions.
  - e.g. "the years in descending order" -> "the years from the most recent to the oldest"
- Output only the rewritten question, without any additional explanation.

=== Example ===
Cypher: MATCH (n:Taxon)<-[r0:hasParent]-(m0:Taxon)-[r1:hasConservationStatus]->(m1:ConservationStatus {name: 'Near Threatened'}) WITH DISTINCT n RETURN n.name
question: List the names of Taxon that [some Taxon that hasConservationStatus "Near Threatened"] hasParent
rewritten_question: What are the names of parents of taxa with a conservation status of Near Threatened?

Cypher: MATCH (n:Character)<-[r0:hasFather]-(m0:Character),(n:Character)<-[r1:killedBy]-(m0:Character) WITH DISTINCT n RETURN n.name
question: List the names of Character that a Character [hasFather and killedBy].
rewritten_question: List the names of fathers who killed their children.
